# Forest Area Classifier

A comprehensive guide and implementation for forest area classification and monitoring using [FAO](https://www.fao.org/home/en) [forest definition](https://www.fao.org/3/ad665e/ad665e03.htm). This repository contains methodologies, code, and documentation for identifying and measuring forest areas through various classification approaches.

## Overview

This project aims to:
- Implement forest classification based on FAO's forest definition
- Provide annual forest area measurements in hectares
- Document methodologies and approaches for forest area classification
- Offer reproducible workflows for forest monitoring

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [insert-github-pages-url].

## Features

- Implementation of multiple classification methods
- Compliance with FAO forest definition criteria
- Annual forest area calculation
- Validation and accuracy assessment
- Comprehensive methodology documentation
- Reproducible Jupyter notebooks

## Prerequisites
