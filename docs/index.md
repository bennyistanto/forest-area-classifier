# Forest Area Classsifier: A Machine Learning Approach Using Earth Observation Data

This documentation presents a systematic methodology for forest area classification using machine learning approaches, specifically focusing on Random Forest with Earth Observation (EO) data. Our approach follows the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forest definition guidelines while providing flexibility to adapt to country-specific contexts.

## Overview

The documentation guides readers through the complete workflow of developing a forest area classification system, from data preparation to model implementation and validation. We cover:

- Theoretical foundations and context of forest area classification
- Detailed inventory of Earth Observation and ancillary data sources
- Step-by-step methodology for data preprocessing and model development
- Implementation guidelines for annual mapping
- Validation approaches and accuracy assessment
- Temporal consistency considerations

## Current Progress

The documentation currently includes four detailed chapters:

1. **Introduction**: Background context, importance of forest monitoring, and project objectives
2. **Data Inventory & Sources**: Comprehensive listing and description of multi-temporal data sources
3. **Data Preparation & Preprocessing**: Methods for temporal data harmonization and feature engineering
4. **Modeling Methodology**: Random Forest implementation, spatial cross-validation, and model evaluation

## Upcoming Sections

Future chapters will cover:
- Implementation Plan for Annual Mapping
- Time Series Analysis and Consistency
- Results & Discussion
- Conclusions & Next Steps
- Technical Appendices

## Target Audience

This documentation is designed for:
- Remote sensing specialists
- Forest ecosystem experts
- Machine learning practitioners
- Environmental scientists
- Technical staff working on forest monitoring and assessment
- Conservation planners

## How to Use This Book

- Each chapter builds upon previous content in a logical sequence
- Code examples are provided in Python using common geospatial and time series analysis libraries
- Practical implementation tips for handling annual data are highlighted throughout
- References and technical details are provided in appendices

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 for understanding the context and objectives of forest mapping, or jump directly to Chapter 4 for the technical methodology if you're familiar with forest monitoring concepts.
